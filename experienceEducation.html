								<p> I am currently completing a 12-month internship at AMD as a Design Verification Engineer. Over the past 6 years, I have pursued my strong interest in software development and computer architecture through many projects. These included building an android application in Java through Android Studio to improve building inspections for a property management company, researching and implementing multiple stock trading bots, developing an obstacle avoidance algorithm that ran on an emulated version of a mars rover and developing 2-D videogames on Unity. I have become more involved in my community through my interest in software development by working as a teaching assistant for an introductory Object-Oriented course in Java, tutoring 2nd year students in their Data structure’s class and tutoring 1st year students in their Intro to Computer Programming Course. I am expanding my areas of expertise through personal projects like developing my own personal website, which is listed below, and programming a bitcoin library from scratch in Python through Jupyter Notebook.</p>
								<br />
								<p>My passion in finance led me to obtain a summer job at a real estate management company as an assistant property manager during high school. During this time, I enhanced the bookkeeping system and delivered biweekly market analysis reports to clients. My next job in the industry was as a Junior Asset Manager/Android Software Developer for a property management company during the summer after my second year of studies. Here I created data analysis tools through Microsoft Flows and Excel that produced customizable financial reports and metrics. Pursuing an expansion in my field of knowledge, I joined the Canadian Engineers in Business Case Competition and made it to the finals, which further fueled my interest in the industry. My curiosity in finances took me to the stock market where I merged my interest in coding and finances into a personal project to develop a stock trading bot in python. I proceeded to join QUANTT during my second year as a general member, where I developed a better stock trading bot. That summer I participated in an algorithm trading competition where I developed my third stock trading bot and won the competition. The following year, I was selected as part of the QUANTT executive team to manage the club’s website and marketing material. </p>
