								<p>I am currently completing a 4-month Co-Op at TD as a Quality Engineer where I am Using Cucumber, Selenium and Java to create and automate BDD test cases. Previously I completed a 12-month internship at AMD as a Design Verification Engineer where I developed and maintained internal tools written in Python, using SQL as a database. Over the past 6 years, I have pursued my strong interest in software development and computer architecture through many projects. These included building an android app through Android Studio to improve building inspections for a property management company, researching and implementing multiple stock trading bots, developing my own website and programming a bitcoin library from scratch in Python using Jupyter Notebooks. I have become more involved in my community through my interest in software development by working as a teaching assistant for an introduction to programming course and providing personal tutoring for introduction to objected oriented programming and introduction to algorithms courses.</p>
								<br />
								<p>My passion for finance led me to obtain a summer job as a Junior Asset Manager/Android Software Developer for a property management company during the summer after my second year of studies. Here I created data analysis tools through Microsoft Flows and Excel that produced customizable financial reports and metrics. I joined the Canadian Engineers in Business Case Competition and made it to the finals, which further fueled my interest in the industry. My curiosity in finances took me to the stock market where I merged my interest in coding and finances into a personal project to develop a stock trading bot in python. I proceeded to join QUANTT during my second year as a general member, where I developed a better stock trading bot. That summer I participated in an algorithm trading competition where I developed my third stock trading bot and won the competition. The following year, I was selected as part of the QUANTT executive team to manage the club’s website and marketing material. For my last year, I have been selected to be a senior consultant for the Queen’s University Business Engineering club where I will be leading a group of 6 consultants to deliver a solution to the assigned client firm. </p>
